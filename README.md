# Formal Languages and Compilers
The project implements a parser for a generic programming language P.
The code generated by the parser can be converted into bytecode with [jasmin](http://jasmin.sourceforge.net/).
The project is divided into 5 sets of exercises.

- Es1: Warm up exercises, various DFA.
- Es2: first approach to the lexer.
- Es3: first approach to the parser for a simplified grammar.
- Es4: now we can evaluate expressions.
- Es5: end product, a functional and complete parser.
